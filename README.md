Solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) written in Rust 🦀

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (2021 edition or later)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barclayd/advent-of-code-2024.git
cd advent-of-code-2024
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Start a new day

Prerequisites: 

* Get your AoC Session Cookie

This can be done by copying the value by going to https://adventofcode.com/ and opening Dev Tools.
Chrome: `Application` => `Cookies` => `https://adventofcode.com/` => `session: <value>`
Copy the value and paste it into a newly created `.env`, based on `.env.local`

```sh
brew install pup
./scripts/new-day.sh
```

* This will generate a new folder with a template ready to be worked on, including test setup and a blank a `test.txt`.

`test.txt` requires manual copying and pasting from the puzzle html at present

### Get input

```shell
./scripts/puzzle-input.sh
```

This command auto generates your `input.txt` file and places it in the latest day folder.

For example, if you are working on a solution for Day 4, it will place it in `/day-04/input.txt`, ready to be used in your solution.

It is to be run when you have understood the puzzle and your tests locally for `test.txt` are passing.
